    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      To make sure my client's website is secure i would advise to:
      <p>- Never trust data from the browser, always sanitize data and always assume the worst</p>
    </p>
    <p>- To only show the last four digits of potential creditcards, only store and display needed data</p>
    <p>
      - Implement a automatic timeout if the user has been inactive after a
      period of time, normally this is made by backend developers, but as
      frontend developers we have to take this into consideration with the API.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Sanatising all datapackages to avoid security threats and SQL injection,
      this can be done manually or via a trusted Third Party Solution
    </p>
    <p>
      - Requiring a long user password which includes numbers, small and capital
      letters. Aditionally you can add a two-factor authenticator.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Use a CI/CD tool which will automatically look through any new changes
      and flag anything that doesnt pass the checks it goes through
    </p>
    <p>- Configure the web browser to use both HTTPS and HSTS</p>
    <P>- Take use of Vulnerability scanning tools</P>
